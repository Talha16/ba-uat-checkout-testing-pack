# UAT Testing Pack – E-Commerce Checkout Flow

This repository simulates UAT (User Acceptance Testing) documentation a Business Analyst may create to support validation of an e-commerce checkout flow.

The project includes:
- UAT overview and scope
- Test scenarios and test cases aligned to business requirements
- Defect log template with sample defects
- UAT sign-off notes (sample)

This is a fictional portfolio project designed for interview discussion and learning purposes.

## BA Responsibilities Demonstrated
- Translating requirements and user stories into UAT test scenarios
- Supporting business validation of checkout functionality
- Logging and triaging defects with clear reproduction steps
- Coordinating UAT toward business sign-off

This project reflects typical BA involvement during the UAT phase of Agile delivery.
